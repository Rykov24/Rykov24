## 👋 Hey there! I'm Rykov
I'm a hardware designer at Savoy, focusing on developing next-gen drones 🚁. I design the physical components, sensors, and power systems, making sure they integrate seamlessly with the software.

- 🔧 Working on: [Savoy's Drone Project](https://github.com/Savoy-Research-Institute/Ursa-Minor)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm obsessed with optimizing designs. sufficiently developed technology is indistinguishable from magic
- 🌱 Currently exploring: advanced aerodynamics and sustainable control logic.
- 👀 I'm interested in humanoid robotics/intelligence. I think human beings are cool in how they build things
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on making battery management software for electric devices, like drones and gliders
- 📫 I'm somewhere on twitter
- 😄 Pronouns: ... hehe
- ⚡ another Fun fact: ...kangaroos can beat you up in a fist fight
